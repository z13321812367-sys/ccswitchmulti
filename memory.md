# CC Switch Repository Memory

## 2026-06-11 Codex Windows App Upgrade Strategy

- User reported Codex CLI update failure from the CC Switch settings page: current `0.137.0`, latest `0.139.0`, toast stack included `aws_lc_0_39_0_jent_entropy_switch_notime...`.
- Local diagnosis:
  - Default `codex` resolves to `C:\Users\sunda\AppData\Local\OpenAI\Codex\bin\codex.exe`.
  - Another Codex executable exists under `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_26.608.1337.0_x64__2p2nqsd0c76g0\app\resources\codex.exe`.
  - `codex --version` is `codex-cli 0.137.0`.
  - `codex update` says it cannot detect the installation method.
  - `npm view @openai/codex version` is `0.139.0`, but `winget upgrade --id 9PLM9XGG6VKS --source msstore` reports no available Store upgrade.
- Root cause: the previous Windows lifecycle updater treated Codex App/MSIX launcher paths as ordinary system/npm installs and could build `codex update || npm i -g @openai/codex@latest`, mixing the Codex App runtime with the user's WinGet Node/npm.
- Fix in `src-tauri/src/commands/misc.rs`:
  - Classify `AppData\Local\OpenAI\Codex`, `WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_...`, and `Microsoft\WindowsApps\codex.exe` paths as `codex-app`.
  - For Codex App/MSIX installs, generate a Store package update command with `winget upgrade --id 9PLM9XGG6VKS --source msstore --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements`.
  - Do not attach npm fallback for this install source.
  - If multiple Codex entries are detected and no default install can be selected, any Codex App/MSIX entry forces the Store update command instead of the static `codex update || npm ...` fallback.
- Regression coverage:
  - `codex_windows_app_uses_ms_store_upgrade_without_npm_fallback`.
  - `ambiguous_codex_app_install_uses_ms_store_upgrade`.
  - `windows_codex_app_is_identified`.
  - Validation passed: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml anchored_upgrade_windows --lib`, `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml install_source_classification --lib`, `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --check`, `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml`.

## 2026-06-08 Router UI/Save Logic Fix

- Latest user symptom: after launching the portable build and selecting `OpenAI Multi-Model Router`, Codex Desktop still only showed OpenAI/GPT candidates and lost `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, DeepSeek, and Qwen. The CC Switch list also showed `OpenAI Multi-Model Router` with the `不支持路由` badge.
- Multi-agent assessment: this was a narrow local state + UI/save-path diagnosis, so the main agent handled it directly instead of spawning subagents. Verification was done through process checks, DB inspection, typecheck, and packaging.
- Live process check:
  - Running process was PID `48844`, started `2026-06-08 20:39:21`.
  - Path: `C:\Users\sunda\Documents\LLMservice\cc-switch\src-tauri\target-router-fix-20260608_172503\release\bundle\portable\cc-switch.exe`.
  - This was the earlier 17:34 router-candidate portable, not the newer UI/save-logic fixed build below.
- Local DB hotfix:
  - Backup directory: `C:\Users\sunda\.cc-switch\backups\codex-router-category-fix-20260608_205059`.
  - `codex-openai-router.category` was corrected from `official` to `aggregator`.
  - Current provider was left as `codex-official`; no runtime switch away from the user's backup/official line was performed.
- Current Codex config check:
  - `C:\Users\sunda\.codex\config.toml` currently has no `model_provider`, `model_catalog_json`, local `base_url`, or `127.0.0.1` router/proxy lines, so Codex Desktop is still effectively on the backup/official config.
  - `C:\Users\sunda\.codex\cc-switch-model-catalog.json` exists and contains 7 model slugs: `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, and `qwen3.6`.
  - Therefore a missing CodexSpark/DeepSeek/Qwen dropdown after this state means the router takeover was not active, not that the catalog file was absent.
- Root causes:
  - `src/components/providers/ProviderCard.tsx` treated every Codex `official` category provider as `不支持路由`, even when `settings_config.codexRouting` existed. A router provider with official OAuth routes must still be treated as proxy-routed.
  - `src/hooks/useProviderActions.ts` only required the proxy for non-official providers. A Codex router with `codexRouting` now also requires the local proxy even when route auth uses managed official OAuth.
  - `src/components/providers/forms/ProviderForm.tsx` skipped `modelCatalog` and `codexRouting` persistence for category `official`, and only saved the model catalog for `openai_chat`. The router's outer API is `openai_responses`, so editing/saving it could wipe the generated catalog and routes.
- Code fix:
  - `ProviderCard.tsx` now detects `settings_config.codexRouting`, marks such Codex providers as needing routing, and suppresses the false `不支持路由` badge.
  - `useProviderActions.ts` now treats Codex router providers as local-proxy-required providers and allows them during proxy takeover.
  - `ProviderForm.tsx` now preserves `modelCatalog` and `codexRouting` when routing is enabled or routes exist, including router providers whose outer API format is `openai_responses`.
- Verification:
  - `pnpm typecheck` passed.
  - `pnpm tauri build --bundles nsis --config "$env:TEMP\cc-switch-tauri-no-updater.json"` passed.
- Latest UI/save-logic fixed artifacts:
  - Portable exe: `C:\Users\sunda\Documents\LLMservice\cc-switch\src-tauri\target-router-ui-fix-20260608_210732\release\bundle\portable\cc-switch.exe`
    - SHA256 `4D3E0A7EC297901CEEAB972B3B70018521F0052077AEB6062F4468BE2B6F036A`

    - SHA256 `1D7338E7F137D5CA1888F3A966F8877DA26CB8F3CEE8A87324075F0EE53CDAC7`
  - NSIS installer: `C:\Users\sunda\Documents\LLMservice\cc-switch\src-tauri\target-router-fix-20260608_172503\release\bundle\nsis\CC Switch_3.16.1_x64-setup.exe`
    - SHA256 `A1194B9A55BB2478BA182FAB1A6C7FF9AACA6DEED450A4A4662947099D5C298A`
- Architecture clarification:
  - `OpenAI Multi-Model Router` is not merely upstream CC Switch's native provider switcher, and it is not an external script. It depends on the local Codex multi-model routing patch now present in this repo.
  - Native CC Switch routing/proxy takeover can redirect Codex to one selected provider, but by itself it does not create a single Codex Desktop model dropdown containing OpenAI, CodexSpark, DeepSeek, and Qwen candidates.
  - The patched path has three required layers: `settings_config.modelCatalog` projects `~/.codex/cc-switch-model-catalog.json` so Codex can display all candidates; `settings_config.codexRouting` stores model-to-upstream routes; the Rust local proxy resolves the request `model` via `resolve_codex_model_routed_provider` and converts Responses to Chat where needed.
  - Therefore the multi-model dropdown requires CC Switch local proxy/takeover plus the patched `modelCatalog`/`codexRouting` implementation. Switching ordinary providers alone is not enough.

## 2026-06-08 Router Candidate/Timeout Fix Package

- Root cause found in the local user DB:
  - `codex-openai-router.settings_config.modelCatalog.models` only contained 4 OpenAI models, so Codex candidate model UI could not show DeepSeek/Qwen.
  - `codex-openai-router.settings_config.codexRouting` was missing, so even a selected DeepSeek/Qwen model would not have a route.
  - Code gap: `src-tauri/src/services/provider/live.rs::restore_live_settings_for_provider_backfill` preserved DB-only `modelCatalog` but not DB-only `codexRouting`; switch-away backfill from Live could wipe the router route table because Live `config.toml` cannot represent it.
- Code fix:
  - `src-tauri/src/services/provider/live.rs` now preserves both `modelCatalog` and `codexRouting` during Codex backfill.
  - Regression test added: `codex_switch_backfill_preserves_stored_codex_routing_when_live_lacks_it`.
- Local DB fix:
  - Backup: `C:\Users\sunda\.cc-switch\backups\codex-router-multimodel-fix-20260608_172503\cc-switch.db.before`.
  - Current provider was left as `codex-official`; no official/backup runtime switch was performed.
  - Router catalog models now include `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, and `qwen3.6`.
  - Router routes:
    - `openai-official`: `gpt-*` -> `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`, `openai_responses`, `managed_codex_oauth`.
    - `deepseek`: `deepseek-*` -> `https://api.deepseek.com`, `openai_chat`. DeepSeek key is currently empty, so the candidate appears but requests need a key before success.
    - `qwen-local`: `qwen3.6` -> `https://www.matrixminecraft.cn:24443/vllm/v1`, `openai_chat`, `apiKey=vllm-local`.
- Verification:
  - `cargo test codex_switch_backfill --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml`
  - `cargo test codex_route --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml`
  - `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml --check`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - Qwen upstream `/v1/models` returned `qwen3.6`.
- Latest artifacts were built into an isolated target to avoid overwriting the currently running old portable instance:

- Packaging note:
  - `pnpm tauri build` produced the release exe, NSIS, and MSI but exited 1 at updater artifact signing because `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is not set. The portable zip was manually generated from the new release exe, matching the existing local portable maintenance pattern.
  - To test the new portable build, close the old local modified CC Switch window first; the single-instance plugin can otherwise bring the old process to front. Codex official does not need to be stopped.

## 2026-06-08 DeepSeek Key Local Configuration

- User provided a DeepSeek key and asked to configure it locally. Do not commit or document the full key; only use masked form `sk-b931...b870` in notes.
- Backup directory before the write: `C:\Users\sunda\.cc-switch\backups\codex-deepseek-key-20260608_203307`.
- Updated local DB fields:
  - `codex-deepseek.settings_config.auth.OPENAI_API_KEY`.
  - `codex-openai-router.settings_config.auth.OPENAI_API_KEY`.
  - `codex-openai-router.settings_config.codexRouting.routes[id=deepseek].upstream.apiKey`.
- Current provider was left as `codex-official`; no switch/takeover was performed.
- Lightweight verification against `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/models` succeeded and returned `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`.

## 2026-06-08 Packaging And Maintenance

- Current local build artifacts:
  - NSIS installer: `C:\Users\sunda\Documents\LLMservice\cc-switch\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\CC Switch_3.16.1_x64-setup.exe`
  - Portable zip: `C:\Users\sunda\Documents\LLMservice\cc-switch\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\portable\CC Switch_3.16.1_x64-portable.zip`
  - Portable exe: `C:\Users\sunda\Documents\LLMservice\cc-switch\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\portable\cc-switch.exe`
  - Raw release exe: `C:\Users\sunda\Documents\LLMservice\cc-switch\src-tauri\target\release\cc-switch.exe`
- Local verification before packaging:
  - `pnpm run typecheck`
  - `cargo test codex --lib` from `src-tauri`
- Recommended local packaging command:
  - Create temp config `C:\Users\sunda\AppData\Local\Temp\cc-switch-tauri-no-updater.json` with `{"bundle":{"createUpdaterArtifacts":false}}`.
  - Run `pnpm tauri build --bundles nsis --config "$env:TEMP\cc-switch-tauri-no-updater.json"`.
- Do not use plain `pnpm run build` as the final local handoff command unless `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is available and MSI/WiX is intentionally required.
  - Current `tauri.conf.json` has updater public key plus `createUpdaterArtifacts=true`, so local builds without a private key fail after bundle generation.
  - Full target builds also invoke MSI/WiX; `light.exe` has previously made the command exit 1 even when `cc-switch.exe` and installer files were produced.
  - Treat the NSIS no-updater command above as the reliable local packaging path.
- Portable package maintenance:
  - Copy `src-tauri\target\release\cc-switch.exe` to `src-tauri\target\release\bundle\portable\cc-switch.exe`.
  - Zip only that exe into `CC Switch_3.16.1_x64-portable.zip`.
  - Portable and installed builds share user data in `~/.cc-switch` and `~/.codex`; do not run them concurrently with the official production app.
- Official production app safety:
  - Do not stop or restart the installed official process during local diagnosis/build work.
  - Last verified official process path: `C:\Users\sunda\AppData\Local\Programs\CC Switch\cc-switch.exe`.

## 2026-06-08 Local Codex Provider Cleanup

- User restored historical `~/.cc-switch` config and explicitly said future cleanup must not use that DB content as a template.
- Canonical Codex provider writes should follow latest repo schema:
  - Pure official fallback: `codex-official`, `settings_config={"auth":{},"config":""}`, no `model_provider`, no `base_url`, no `model_catalog_json`, no `codexRouting`.
  - New router providers must use `settings_config.codexRouting`; legacy `codexModelRoutes` / `modelRoutes` are read-only compatibility paths.
  - `meta.apiFormat` and route `upstream.apiFormat` are the explicit API-format source for proxy conversion.
  - Chat-compatible DeepSeek/Qwen providers should use `meta.apiFormat="openai_chat"` and TOML `wire_api="chat"`.
  - Do not put router TOML, `model_catalog_json`, or `127.0.0.1:15721/15722` into `settings.common_config_codex`.
- Local machine cleanup performed 2026-06-08 15:10:
  - Kept only `codex-official`, `codex-openai-router`, `codex-qwen-local`, and `codex-deepseek`.
  - Set `currentProviderCodex="codex-official"`, `enableLocalProxy=false`, cleared `common_config_codex`, disabled Codex takeover flags, and removed Codex `proxy_live_backup`.
  - Backup path: `C:\Users\sunda\.cc-switch\backups\codex-clean-20260608_150944`.

## 2026-06-08 Codex Local Model Routing

### Product Direction Update

- User clarified that the main UI should be a separate Model Router workspace, not only an embedded route editor inside `CodexFormFields`.
- Desired flow: configure or import multiple model sources first, then select sources and merge them into one router provider that Codex reaches through CC Switch local proxy.
- Prototype artifacts:
  - `docs/prototypes/codex-router-workspace-prototype.html`
  - `docs/guides/codex-model-router-workspace-prototype.md`
- Existing `CodexFormFields` Local model routing editor should be treated as an advanced/generated-config surface unless the prototype review decides otherwise.
- Prototype v2 decision: the Model Router workspace must follow the existing CCSwitch header/AppSwitcher/provider-card style, not a generic SaaS dashboard or left-sidebar layout.
- Prototype v2 entry/exit rules: users can enter from the Codex Provider list, the Codex provider form, or Universal Provider; after publish they return to the Codex Provider list with the generated router provider highlighted.
- Prototype v2 source library rules: source setup must guide provider creation/import, base URL/auth/API format setup, connection test, model fetch, capability query, manual capability edit, and real route testing.
- Prototype v2 catalog rules: one provider/source may expose many upstream models, so UI must support fetched model lists and user-controlled visible models before writing Codex model catalog.
- Prototype v2 publish rule: route success must be tested through the CC Switch Rust local proxy before final publish; static config validation alone is not enough.
- Proposed UI component split for real implementation: `src/components/codex-router/ModelRouterWorkspace.tsx`, `RouterSourceLibrary.tsx`, `RouterSourceEditorDialog.tsx`, `RouterModelCatalogPanel.tsx`, `RouterSummaryPanel.tsx`, `RouteTestPanel.tsx`, and a draft/publish adapter.
- Prototype v3 visual correction: the static prototype must use CCSwitch's dark desktop-app style, wide 16:10 window proportions, top toolbar/app switcher, orange circular add button, blue active borders, and long horizontal provider cards.
- Prototype v3 information architecture: split the router workspace into multiple pages (`Overview`, `Sources`, `Models`, `Routes`, `Test & Publish`) using left-side step navigation; do not stack all router content into one vertical long page.

### Branch And Sync

- Feature branch: `feat/codex-local-model-routing`.
- Created from latest `origin/main` after stashing the old local WIP.
- Protective stash kept for now: `stash@{0}` named `wip-codex-local-routing-before-upstream-sync-20260608-005258`.
- Untracked `run-release-and-check.bat` existed after applying the stash; do not delete it unless the owner confirms it is disposable.

### Canonical Config

- New route config lives under `settings_config.codexRouting`.
- Shape:
  - `enabled`: enables/disables the resolver.
  - `defaultRouteId`: fallback route id when no exact/prefix rule matches.
  - `routes[]`: user-defined route list.
- Route fields:
  - `id`, `label`, `enabled`.
  - `match.models` for exact model ids.
  - `match.prefixes` for model id prefixes.
  - `upstream.baseUrl`.
  - `upstream.apiFormat`: `openai_responses`, `openai_chat`, or `openai_messages`.
  - `upstream.auth.source`: first version supports `provider_config`, `managed_codex_oauth`, and `managed_account`.
  - `upstream.apiKey` for provider-config key material when needed.
  - `upstream.modelMap` for Codex model id to upstream model id mapping.
  - `capabilities.textOnly`, `capabilities.inputModalities`, `capabilities.supportsReasoning`.
- Legacy fields `settings_config.codexModelRoutes` and `settings_config.modelRoutes` are read-only fallbacks. The UI may load them and save back to `codexRouting`.
- `reuse_provider:<id>` is intentionally not supported in the first version.

### Rust Entry Points

- Route resolver and effective provider construction:
  - `src-tauri/src/proxy/providers/codex.rs`
  - Main entry: `resolve_codex_model_routed_provider`.
  - Effective routed provider id format: `{outer_provider_id}::route::{route_id}`.
  - Managed Codex OAuth routes must remove inherited provider `auth` / `apiKey`; otherwise stale Bearer keys can override the managed account chain.
- Forwarding and protocol selection:
  - `src-tauri/src/proxy/forwarder.rs`
  - Reuses existing forwarder flow after route resolution.
  - Supports Responses passthrough, Responses -> Chat, and Responses -> Messages endpoint handling.
- Responses to Chat conversion:
  - `src-tauri/src/proxy/providers/transform_codex_chat.rs`
  - Text-only route capability prevents emitting Chat `image_url` blocks.
- Model catalog capability generation:
  - `src-tauri/src/codex_config.rs`
  - Route capabilities override hardcoded text-only model-name fallbacks.

### Frontend Entry Points

- Shared types:
  - `src/types.ts`
  - `CodexRoutingConfig`, `CodexRoutingRoute`, `CodexRoutingAuth`, `CodexRoutingCapabilities`.
- Codex config state:
  - `src/components/providers/forms/hooks/useCodexConfigState.ts`
  - Reads `codexRouting`; migrates `codexModelRoutes` / `modelRoutes` into UI state.
- Provider save path:
  - `src/components/providers/forms/ProviderForm.tsx`
  - Saves `settings_config.codexRouting` when routing is enabled or routes exist.
- Codex UI:
  - `src/components/providers/forms/CodexFormFields.tsx`
  - Adds **Local model routing** controls as a route summary list plus an edit dialog for match rules, upstream API format, auth, mapping, and capabilities.
  - The Local model routing panel is independent of endpoint speed-test visibility; it should show whenever the Codex form has routing state.
  - Switching a route from `provider_config` to a managed auth source should clear route `apiKey` so stale keys are not persisted.
- i18n keys live under `codexConfig` in:
  - `src/i18n/locales/en.json`
  - `src/i18n/locales/zh.json`
  - `src/i18n/locales/zh-TW.json`
  - `src/i18n/locales/ja.json`

### Docs

- Existing DeepSeek guide paths are now generic Codex Local Model Routing guides:
  - `docs/guides/codex-deepseek-routing-guide-en.md`
  - `docs/guides/codex-deepseek-routing-guide-zh.md`
  - `docs/guides/codex-deepseek-routing-guide-ja.md`
- The filenames still contain `deepseek` for link compatibility, but the content is generic and UTF-8.

### Validation Commands Used

- Rust focused validation:
  - `cargo fmt`
  - `cargo test codex --lib`
- Frontend type validation:
  - `pnpm run typecheck`
- Frontend route UI validation:
  - `pnpm vitest run tests/components/CodexFormFields.test.tsx tests/components/ProviderForm.codexCatalog.test.ts`
- Renderer build validation:
  - `pnpm run build:renderer`

### Maintenance Notes

- When fixing route bugs, update this file if the schema, resolver behavior, or capability semantics change.
- If text-only/image behavior changes, update both catalog generation and Responses -> Chat conversion tests.
- Keep Codex connected to the CC Switch Rust local proxy for this design; route selection should depend on `body.model`, not the GUI's currently selected upstream provider.

## 2026-06-08 Codex v2 DeepSeek v4 Local Proxy Fix

- Canonical user-facing model spelling for this workspace is `deepseekv4`, while configured aliases may include `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, or display names such as `DeepSeek V4 Pro`.
- The intended Codex path is still v2 through the CC Switch Rust local proxy: Codex sends `/responses` to `http://127.0.0.1:<proxy>/v1`, CC Switch selects a route, then translates to the route upstream format when needed.
- The DeepSeek v4 failure was not caused by the old user script. It came from the built-in Rust Responses -> Chat conversion emitting Chat `content[]` image blocks for a text-only upstream. DeepSeek rejected this with `unknown variant image_url, expected text`.
- Text-only detection for DeepSeek v4 must use compact model-id normalization so `deepseekv4`, `deepseek-v4-*`, and spaced display aliases are all treated the same.
- Keep DeepSeek v4 text-only behavior aligned across `src-tauri/src/proxy/providers/transform_codex_chat.rs`, `src-tauri/src/codex_config.rs`, and `src-tauri/src/proxy/media_sanitizer.rs`.
- GUI route creation should not persist default `capabilities: { textOnly:false, inputModalities:["text","image"], supportsReasoning:false }` for new routes, because that can create a false explicit image-capability override.
- Route-level `codexChatReasoning.minOutputTokens` is supported for Chat upstreams that need a larger minimum output budget to avoid reasoning consuming tiny Codex probe responses.
- Validation commands used for this fix: `cargo fmt`, `cargo test transform_codex_chat --lib`, `cargo test media_sanitizer --lib`, `cargo test codex_model_catalog --lib`, `cargo test codex --lib`, and `node node_modules\typescript\bin\tsc --noEmit`.

## 2026-06-08 Codex Multi-Model Router Detail Fix

- The working router provider is the patched CC Switch Rust local proxy path, not native provider switching alone. Codex connects to CC Switch, the proxy reads `body.model`, resolves `settings_config.codexRouting`, and forwards to OpenAI official, DeepSeek, or Qwen.
- Stable Codex history bucket for this local router is `codex_model_router_v2`. Avoid reintroducing `cc_switch_codex_router`; it splits Codex Desktop history into another provider bucket. On this machine, old `codex_model_router` rows were merged into `codex_model_router_v2` with backup at `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\backups\router-provider-v2-merge-20260608_225952`.
- Router provider DB config currently uses `model_provider = "codex_model_router_v2"` with `[model_providers.codex_model_router_v2] base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:15721/v1"` and `wire_api = "responses"`.
- Route/candidate catalog currently exposes 7 models: `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, and `qwen3.6`.
- `src-tauri/src/codex_config.rs` must preserve `additional_speed_tiers` and `service_tiers` for OpenAI official `gpt-*` entries, except `codex-spark`; third-party/local models should still clear these fields so the UI does not show official service tiers on DeepSeek/Qwen.
- Existing on-disk catalog was manually refreshed after the code fix; old file backup is `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\backups\catalog-speed-tiers-20260608_231320`.
- `src-tauri/src/proxy/codex_router_log.rs` writes compact diagnostics to `%USERPROFILE%\.cc-switch\logs\codex-router.log`. It logs route, auth, request preparation, upstream send/status/error, and response readiness by trace id without raw prompt, token, header, or SSE content.
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` should not delete `%USERPROFILE%\.cc-switch\logs\cc-switch.log` on startup; early router cutover errors must survive restart.
- Avoid raw request/SSE logs in normal Debug/Trace. `forwarder.rs` should log request bytes plus body hash; `response_processor.rs` should only parse SSE when usage collection requires it.

## 2026-06-09 CCSwitchMulti Config Preservation And Packaging

- Current local modified build is branded `CCSwitchMulti` to distinguish it from the official `CC Switch` binary. The app still uses the existing `.cc-switch` data directory so provider DB/config history remains shared; do not rename the config directory unless deliberately doing a clean-room install.
- Package identity for the modified installer is `com.ccswitchmulti.desktop`; deep-link scheme is `ccswitchmulti`. This prevents the local installer from being treated as the same app identity as official `com.ccswitch.desktop`.
- MSI packaging rejects prerelease ids like `multi.1`; use numeric prerelease `3.16.1-1` for this local build line. The visible distinction comes from `productName = "CCSwitchMulti"` plus the numeric local build suffix.
- Current delivery directory: `src-tauri/target-ccswitchmulti-20260609_001033/`.
  - Portable zip: `CCSwitchMulti_3.16.1-1_x64-portable.zip`.
  - Portable exe: `CCSwitchMulti.exe`.
  - NSIS installer: `CCSwitchMulti_3.16.1-1_x64-setup.exe`.
  - MSI installer: `CCSwitchMulti_3.16.1-1_x64_en-US.msi` copied from `src-tauri/target/release/wix/x64/output.msi` after Tauri's MSI final copy failed.
- Build cleanup on 2026-06-09 removed stale local modified targets `src-tauri/target-router-fix-20260608_172503`, `src-tauri/target-router-ui-fix-20260608_210732`, and `src-tauri/target-router-detail-fix-20260608_230505`, the default build cache `src-tauri/target`, and the old root release artifacts `cc-switch-release` / `cc-switch-release.zip`. A stale portable process from `target-router-detail-fix-20260608_230505` had to be stopped to unlock that old directory; the official backup instance was not stopped.
- After cleanup, only `src-tauri/target-ccswitchmulti-20260609_001033` should be used for current delivery artifacts. Do not hand users any old `target-router-*`, default `target`, or root `cc-switch-release*` artifact paths.
- In this environment `pnpm` may be absent from PATH, while local `node_modules` exists. `tauri.conf.json` now uses `node ./node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build` for `beforeBuildCommand`; frontend validation can use `.\node_modules\.bin\tsc.CMD --noEmit`.
- Tauri NSIS bundling can return exit code 1 after successfully producing setup.exe when updater signing has a public key but no `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`. Treat the generated setup file as usable if it exists and hashes cleanly; record this caveat in handoff.
- Codex history reality on this machine: `state_5.sqlite` had 445 threads during the 2026-06-09 check, with 432 under `codex_model_router_v2` and only 13 under `openai`. Full history is not mostly in `openai`.
- Codex `thread/list` defaults to filtering by current `model_provider` when `modelProviders` is omitted. Passing `modelProviders: []` means no provider filter. Optional `cwd` filters are exact-path filters and can make history appear limited to the current workspaces.
- Do not create another router provider id. Keep router provider config at `model_provider = "codex_model_router_v2"` so the Codex Desktop history bucket stays stable.
- Provider switching must never write provider `config.toml` snapshots verbatim over the current live Codex config. `src-tauri/src/codex_config.rs` now merges provider config with live config: provider top-level scalar fields and `[model_providers.<active-id>]` override, while live `[features]`, `[desktop]`, `[memories]`, `[projects]`, `[mcp_servers]`, plugins, and other user tables are preserved.
- Common config snippets still need to add missing table entries. The merge behavior is "live wins on conflicts, provider/common config fills missing table keys." This preserves user MCP entries while allowing CC Switch common config to add new MCP servers.
- Proxy takeover placeholder branches in `src-tauri/src/services/proxy.rs` must also merge before `write_codex_live_config_atomic`; otherwise switching router during takeover can clear context-window display, memories, MCP, and project trust.
- Validation for this fix used `.\node_modules\.bin\tsc.CMD --noEmit` and `cargo test codex --lib` (318 passed).

## 2026-06-09 CCSwitchMulti History Visibility And Router Preservation Fix

- Live official state after the 2026-06-09 01:20 check: `codex-official` is current in `~/.cc-switch/cc-switch.db`, `currentProviderCodex` is `codex-official`, Codex proxy flags are disabled, and `~/.codex/config.toml` has no local router/proxy lines. If the UI still feels like it did not switch back, first distinguish live config from Codex history filtering.
- Runtime DB repair restored `codex-openai-router.settings_config.codexRouting` with three routes:
  - `openai-official`: `gpt-*` via `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`, `openai_responses`, `managed_codex_oauth`.
  - `deepseek`: `deepseek-v4-flash` / `deepseek-v4-pro` via `https://api.deepseek.com`, `openai_chat`, provider_config key.
  - `qwen-local`: `qwen3.6` via `https://www.matrixminecraft.cn:24443/vllm/v1`, `openai_chat`, `minOutputTokens=2048`.
- Backup before runtime repair: `%USERPROFILE%\.cc-switch\backups\codex-history-official-router-fix-20260609_012627`.
- `src/components/providers/EditProviderDialog.tsx` now preserves both DB-private Codex fields, `modelCatalog` and `codexRouting`, when editing the current provider after reading live settings. This prevents saving a current router provider from erasing its route table.
- `src-tauri/src/codex_config.rs` now preserves OpenAI speed/service tiers only for `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.4`. `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, DeepSeek, Qwen, and other generated catalog entries must have empty `additional_speed_tiers` and `service_tiers`.
- Current on-disk `~/.codex/cc-switch-model-catalog.json` was repaired to match that rule: `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.4` keep `fast/priority`; mini, spark, DeepSeek, and Qwen have no service tiers.
- History visibility analysis from the read-only subagent:
  - `state_5.sqlite` has 448 threads. `session_index.jsonl` has 426 unique ids; sqlite has 24 ids not in the jsonl index and jsonl has 2 ids not in sqlite.
  - Provider buckets: `codex_model_router_v2=433`, `openai=15`.
  - Source buckets: `vscode=223`, `exec=26`, `subagent=199`; archived threads total 142.
  - Visible history is mostly a view/filtering problem, not data loss. Default `thread/list` behavior filters by active provider when `modelProviders` is omitted, hides non-interactive sources when `sourceKinds` is omitted/empty, excludes archived items, applies exact `cwd` filters, and paginates.
  - To surface hidden history safely, prefer fixing the query/view: pass `modelProviders: []`, include non-interactive `sourceKinds`, avoid default exact `cwd`, expose archived separately, and page through `nextCursor`. Do not rewrite sqlite buckets just to make old sessions visible.
- Latest packaged delivery for this fix:
  - Directory: `src-tauri/target-ccswitchmulti-historyfix-20260609_013447/`.
  - Portable exe: `CCSwitchMulti.exe` SHA256 `909933223A40D6AECA5396F3D1B2A2104C22ECD86EF68DB7DF5B493B1D1DD65F`.

- Validation: `vitest` for `EditProviderDialog` and `CodexFormFields` passed 5 tests; `cargo test codex_model_catalog --lib` passed 5 tests; `.\node_modules\.bin\tsc.CMD --noEmit`, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo test codex --lib` passed 319 tests; Tauri no-updater build succeeded.
- The older `src-tauri/target-ccswitchmulti-20260609_001033/CCSwitchMulti.exe` was still running during packaging. Do not delete that old directory until the old process is closed or replaced by the new build.

## 2026-06-09 CCSwitchMulti Rootfix For Codex Official Fallback And Router Pollution

- Supersedes the previous history-bucket assumption: `codex_model_router_v2` is not a universal fix for history visibility. It only described one old local router bucket. Do not rewrite sqlite/jsonl buckets as the default fix for missing history.
- Do not treat the user's current official/default state as proof that the modified build works. The user had to roll back to official release/default config to keep chatting.
- Confirmed root causes:
  - `CodexAdapter::extract_base_url` previously scanned for the first `base_url` string in TOML, so inactive `[model_providers.*]` and `[mcp_servers.*]` entries could contaminate the active provider.
  - Provider/live merge kept stale provider-owned fields. Official fallback with empty config could retain old `model_provider`, `model_catalog_json`, `experimental_bearer_token`, or old `[model_providers.<router>]`, leaving DeepSeek/Qwen candidates visible after switching backup official.
  - Codex common config could deep-merge provider-private router TOML into arbitrary providers.
  - Proxy takeover official switching needed to exit takeover and restore/write live official config instead of trying to hot-switch through the local proxy.
  - The old `preserve_codex_mcp_servers_from_existing_config` path only preserved MCP servers, not full Codex user sections like `[projects]`, `[features]`, `[desktop]`, `[memories]`.
- Implemented fixes:
  - `src-tauri/src/proxy/providers/codex.rs`: base URL extraction uses `crate::codex_config::extract_codex_base_url`, which prefers the active `model_provider`.
  - `src-tauri/src/services/provider/mod.rs`: Codex credential extraction uses the same active TOML parser; switching an official provider during takeover calls `disable_takeover_for_app_after_switch_lock`, sets current provider, writes official live config, and syncs MCP.
  - `src-tauri/src/codex_config.rs`: official empty config now clears provider-owned top-level fields, removes CC Switch-owned `model_catalog_json`, and removes the active custom `[model_providers.<id>]` table while preserving user sections.
  - `src-tauri/src/services/provider/live.rs`: Codex common config strips `model`, `model_provider`, `model_context_window`, `model_catalog_json`, `experimental_bearer_token`, and `[model_providers]`.
  - `src-tauri/src/services/proxy.rs`: backup/live preservation now uses full Codex provider/live merge rather than MCP-only merge. Added regression test for router takeover -> official fallback cleanup.
- Validation commands passed:
  - `.\node_modules\.bin\tsc.CMD --noEmit`
  - `cargo test codex_switch_to_official_during_takeover_exits_proxy_and_cleans_router_fields --lib`

- Packaging notes:
  - Full `tauri build` produced NSIS/MSI but returned 1 because updater signing has a public key and no `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`; use `tauri build --no-bundle` to verify portable exe without signing.
  - Old timestamp package dirs `target-ccswitchmulti-20260609_001033` and `target-ccswitchmulti-historyfix-20260609_013447` were removed after creating the rootfix package. Only the rootfix directory should be handed out now.
  - The current running official app remained `C:\Users\sunda\AppData\Local\Programs\CC Switch\cc-switch.exe`; this rootfix pass did not stop it and did not mutate live `%USERPROFILE%\.cc-switch` or `%USERPROFILE%\.codex` config.

## 2026-06-09 Rootfix DB Provider Write

- After packaging rootfix, the current `%USERPROFILE%\.cc-switch\cc-switch.db` still only had `codex-official` and stale `default`; the package fix alone did not write the user's Codex provider config.
- DB backup before writing: `%USERPROFILE%\.cc-switch\backups\db_backup_before_codex_rootfix_config_20260609_145601.db`.
- Current Codex provider set written to DB:
  - `codex-official` / `OpenAI Official Backup`: official fallback, current provider, empty config/auth.
  - `codex-openai-router` / `OpenAI Multi-Model Router`: local proxy provider with `model_provider="codex_model_router_v2"`, base URL `http://127.0.0.1:15721/v1`, catalog models `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `qwen3.6`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, and `codexRouting` routes `openai-official`, `qwen-local`, `deepseek`.
  - `codex-qwen-local` / `Qwen Local vLLM`: direct optional provider for `qwen3.6`, base URL `https://www.matrixminecraft.cn:24443/vllm/v1`, Chat upstream metadata.
  - `codex-deepseek` / `DeepSeek`: direct optional provider for `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`, base URL `https://api.deepseek.com`, Chat upstream metadata.
- Removed stale provider `default`; it was an imported old router config under a misleading name.
- Cleaned `common_config_codex` by removing provider-owned lines `model_catalog_json`, `model_context_window`, `model_provider`, and `model`; preserved user MCP/plugin/windows/reasoning/auto-compact settings.
- Left Codex proxy disabled and current provider as `codex-official`: `enabled=0`, `proxy_enabled=0`, `live_takeover_active=0`. This avoids disrupting official fallback until the user explicitly enables/switches router.
- UI caveat: already-open CCSwitchMulti windows cache the provider list. Restart/refresh CCSwitchMulti after this DB write to show the four providers.

## 2026-06-09 Current Good Routing State And History Thread Reaudit

- User has now verified this build's Codex routing and OpenAI official fallback configuration are working. Preserve that as the known-good baseline during future debugging.
- Known-good provider layout:
  - `codex-official` / `OpenAI Official Backup`: pure official fallback, empty provider config, safe current provider.
  - `codex-openai-router` / `OpenAI Multi-Model Router`: local proxy provider using active Codex `model_provider = "codex_model_router_v2"` and catalog entries for GPT, Codex Spark, Qwen, and DeepSeek routes.
  - `codex-qwen-local` and `codex-deepseek`: optional direct providers, not replacements for the official fallback.
- Remaining unresolved bug: Codex history threads still do not display/sync as expected. The user says this is related to provider and bucket, and the previous memory around this may be wrong.
- Do not assume `codex_model_router_v2` is a universal history fix and do not rewrite sqlite/jsonl buckets by default. Re-verify Codex Desktop, CCSwitch, and Codex++ behavior around history indexes, provider buckets, accounts, sources, cwd/project filters, archived state, and pagination before implementing a fix.

## 2026-06-09 OpenAI Bucket Semantics And Responses WebSocket Fallback

- Verified against OpenAI Codex docs and local Codex v0.137.0 source: `openai` is a reserved built-in provider id. `model_providers.openai` does not override the built-in provider; `merge_configured_model_providers` keeps the built-in entry. To point built-in OpenAI at a proxy/router, use user-level top-level `openai_base_url`, not `[model_providers.openai].base_url`.
- Built-in `openai` provider semantics that matter for cc-switch:
  - `requires_openai_auth = true`.
  - `wire_api = responses`.
  - `supports_websockets = true`.
  - Normal turns prefer Responses WebSocket before HTTP Responses.
- Root cause of previous `openai` bucket failures/slowness: cc-switch served HTTP `POST /responses` but did not explicitly handle Codex's WebSocket handshake `GET /responses`. Codex switches immediately to HTTP only when the WS connect returns `426 Upgrade Required`; generic 404/405/network failures can cause retries, delay, or timeout.
- Implemented compatibility fix:
  - `src-tauri/src/proxy/server.rs` maps Codex `/responses`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/v1/responses`, and `/codex/v1/responses` as `GET -> handle_responses_websocket_fallback` and `POST -> handle_responses`.
  - `src-tauri/src/proxy/handlers.rs` adds `handle_responses_websocket_fallback`, returning 426 with a small JSON error. This is an intentional signal to the official Codex client to disable WS for the session and use HTTP.
  - `src/utils/providerConfigUtils.ts` no longer treats `openai_base_url` as a `wire_api` value. Added a regression unit test.
  - `src-tauri/src/codex_history_migration.rs` now gates old v1 helper wrappers behind `#[cfg(test)]`.
- Current DB provider state checked read-only with secrets redacted:
  - `codex-official` / `OpenAI Official Backup` is current and pure official fallback.
  - `codex-openai-router` uses `model_provider = "openai"`, top-level `openai_base_url`, `model_catalog_json`, no `[model_providers.openai]`, routes `openai-official`, `qwen-local`, `deepseek`, and catalog models `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `qwen3.6`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`.
- Validation commands passed:
  - `pnpm test:unit tests/utils/providerConfigUtils.codex.test.ts` (26 tests).
  - `cargo test --manifest-path .\src-tauri\Cargo.toml openai_for_v2 --lib` (2 tests).
  - `cargo test --manifest-path .\src-tauri\Cargo.toml responses_websocket_fallback_returns_upgrade_required --lib` (1 test).
  - Focused Rust regressions for `openai_base_url`, router merge, settings migration preservation, and Codex common-config stripping all passed.
- Latest package:
  - Directory: `src-tauri/target-ccswitchmulti-openaibucket-wsfix-20260609_163308/`.
  - Portable exe: `release/bundle/portable/CCSwitchMulti.exe`, SHA256 `DE348E685A03A522B4A2066FD0CAEA900EDE0B50A0433E959897ED4771DFDCC8`.
  - Portable zip: `release/bundle/portable/CCSwitchMulti_3.16.1-1_x64-openai-bucket-wsfix-portable.zip`, SHA256 `0085BAC5C731763D352757A295CC3CEBFF15BFDBCE32FA7BFD0341D56CCD587A`.
  - NSIS installer: `release/bundle/nsis/CCSwitchMulti_3.16.1-1_x64-setup.exe`, SHA256 `3DDD9F93DEF8020CAE12097CCAAFA89807A41C510C40F61696D92353BE2B58BF`.
- Build cleanup: removed default `src-tauri/target` and old `target-ccswitchmulti-rootfix-20260609_032709`. The old rootfix directory was locked by a stale local modified `CCSwitchMulti.exe`, so that stale local process was stopped before deletion. The official installed CC Switch stayed running at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\CC Switch\cc-switch.exe`.
- Operational note: only `src-tauri/target-ccswitchmulti-openaibucket-wsfix-20260609_163308/` should be handed out now. Launching/testing the new portable no longer has an older CCSwitchMulti process competing via single-instance; it is not necessary to stop the user's official Codex/official backup chat process.

## 2026-06-11 Third-party Agent API Public Access Check

- External OpenAI-compatible Agent API is intentionally separated from the Codex/Multi Router main proxy: current external listener is `0.0.0.0:15722`; main proxy `15721` is not listening in the checked runtime.
- Local and trusted-network reachability passed:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:15722/health` returned HTTP 200.
  - LAN addresses `192.168.31.206:15722` and `192.168.31.152:15722` returned HTTP 200 from this host.
  - Tailscale address `100.118.73.52:15722` returned HTTP 200 from this host.
- Public Internet reachability failed from this host:
  - Public IP discovery returned inconsistent exits (`185.151.146.146` from ipify and `117.133.83.107` from ipinfo), indicating proxy/multi-exit/NAT behavior.
  - `http://185.151.146.146:15722/health` and `http://117.133.83.107:15722/health` both timed out.
- Interpreted cause: CC Switch is bound correctly and Windows has enabled inbound `cc-switch.exe` allow rules for Private/Public profiles, so the remaining blocker is likely upstream of the app: router port forwarding, carrier-grade NAT, public IP not mapped to this machine, or external firewall/NAT policy.
- Do not treat公网 timeout as an application regression unless LAN/Tailscale/localhost also fail. For real public exposure, configure router/NAT port forwarding to the machine's active LAN IP or use a tunnel/VPN endpoint, and keep `ccsw_` keys private.
- Added `docs/guides/external-openai-api-relay-domain-guide-zh.md` as the operational handoff guide for exposing the External OpenAI-compatible API through a public relay/domain. The preferred topology is public relay Caddy/Nginx -> private Tailscale or SSH tunnel -> Windows CC Switch `15722`; use route/NAT forwarding only when a real inbound public IP exists.

## 2026-06-12 Codex DeepSeek Direct Provider Local Routing Fix

- Root cause for the reported standalone DeepSeek Codex provider failure: the UI's "需要本地路由映射" intent was stored as `meta.apiFormat = "openai_chat"`, but `ProviderService::switch` only hot-switched when takeover was already active. In normal mode it still wrote the DeepSeek provider directly into Codex live config, so Codex called `https://api.deepseek.com/responses` and DeepSeek returned 404.
- This is not a Third-party Agent API issue and not a DeepSeek documentation issue. DeepSeek's official endpoint is Chat Completions style; Codex still speaks Responses to CC Switch, so the local proxy must sit between Codex and DeepSeek.
- Regression source audit:
  - `1c82b8a3 Add Chat Completions routing for Codex providers` introduced `meta.apiFormat = "openai_chat"` and the proxy conversion path, while keeping generated Codex `wire_api = "responses"` so the Codex client can continue using Responses locally.
  - The same change only added a frontend warning in `useProviderActions`; it did not block normal switch or enable takeover.
  - Existing `ProviderService::switch` behavior from the older switch architecture still treated "not currently taken over" as permission to call `switch_normal -> write_live_with_common_config`, which direct-writes provider config to Codex live files.
  - Later local changes `8af568e4` / `24eca85c` made the UI present this as a first-class local routing / multi-route capability, which made the latent mismatch user-visible: users reasonably expected the switch/config to activate routing, but the backend still only routed if takeover was already active.
  - Official upstream is not able to make DeepSeek work by direct `/responses` either; it works only when Codex is already going through CC Switch proxy/takeover. The fix here is making that invariant backend-enforced instead of relying on user sequence or frontend warning.
- Implemented backend defense:
  - `ProviderService::codex_provider_requires_local_proxy` detects Codex providers that require local proxy because they are Chat Completions backends or contain `codexRouting`.
  - `ProviderService::switch` now auto-enables Codex takeover for such providers when takeover is not already active, instead of taking the normal direct live-write path.
  - `ProxyService::takeover_app_and_switch_provider_after_switch_lock` performs the locked transition: start proxy if needed, back up/sync existing live config, switch current provider, write Codex live config to local proxy `/v1`, update backup/current target, and set per-app takeover enabled.
- Regression test added: `switching_codex_chat_provider_auto_enables_local_proxy_takeover` asserts a DeepSeek `openai_chat` provider switch writes `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1` plus `PROXY_MANAGED` into Codex live config and does not leave `https://api.deepseek.com` in live config.
- Validation passed:

## 2026-06-12 Codex Takeover Model Picker Must Stay On Built-in OpenAI

- Follow-up root cause for the user's "GPT menu shows 自定义, where did the selectable models go" screenshot: after the DeepSeek auto-takeover fix, Codex live config correctly pointed at CC Switch, but it still projected the selected upstream provider id (`deepseek`, `aihubmix`, etc.) into live `model_provider`. Codex then treated the session as a custom provider and the model picker collapsed into the custom-model bucket instead of showing the intended GPT/router catalog choices.
- Correct invariant: during proxy takeover, Codex live `config.toml` should expose the stable built-in OpenAI provider:
  - `model_provider = "openai"`
  - top-level `openai_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1"`
  - `model_catalog_json = "cc-switch-model-catalog.json"` when CC Switch has a model catalog
  - `auth.json` uses `OPENAI_API_KEY = "PROXY_MANAGED"`
  - no upstream `[model_providers.<deepseek/qwen/...>]` table should be exposed in live takeover config.
- Real upstream provider identity and API keys stay in CC Switch DB/backup/provider settings. The proxy resolves the current provider or `codexRouting` by request model and injects upstream credentials internally.
- Implemented fix:
  - `ProxyService::apply_codex_proxy_toml_config_for_provider` now projects takeover TOML to built-in `openai` plus `openai_base_url`, preserving the selected model but stripping upstream provider tables/tokens from live config.
  - `codex_config::merge_codex_provider_config_texts` now removes the active custom provider table when the provider projection targets built-in `openai`, so stale live `[model_providers.*]` tables do not survive the merge.
- Regression coverage:
  - `apply_codex_proxy_toml_config_uses_builtin_openai_proxy_provider`
  - `hot_switch_codex_chat_provider_updates_live_provider_display`
  - `merge_openai_router_config_uses_builtin_openai_history_bucket`
  - `switching_codex_chat_provider_auto_enables_local_proxy_takeover`

## 2026-06-12 CCSwitchMulti v3.16.2-2 Release Export Rule

- Release tag for this fix train is `v3.16.2-2`; do not reuse `v3.16.2-1` because it already exists on `BigStrongSun/cc-switch`.
- Fixed local export directory remains `C:\Users\sunda\Documents\LLMservice\最新版ccswitchmulti`.
- GitHub Release assets cannot safely upload two different files both named `BUILD_ON_PLATFORM.md`; the export script now also writes root-level `linux-build-note.md` and `macos-build-note.md` with unique names for release upload.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` should be generated after those root-level note files are copied, so the checksum list matches the final export directory.
