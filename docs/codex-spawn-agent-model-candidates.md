# Codex spawn_agent model candidates

## Root cause

Codex upstream limits the model list shown in the `spawn_agent` tool description to five picker-visible models.

The relevant upstream implementation is in `codex-rs/core/src/tools/handlers/multi_agents_spec.rs`:

- `MAX_MODEL_OVERRIDES_IN_SPAWN_AGENT_DESCRIPTION: usize = 5`
- `spawn_agent_models_description()` filters `show_in_picker` and then calls `.take(5)`

This is a prompt-description limit, not the runtime model override limit. The `model` parameter schema is a free string, and runtime validation in `multi_agents_common.rs` checks the full available model list. A model such as `deepseek-v4-flash` can work when passed explicitly, even if it is not listed in the first five visible suggestions.

## Why DeepSeek disappeared

CCSwitchMulti writes the full Codex model catalog, including OpenAI, Qwen, DeepSeek, and Spark models. Codex then builds the `spawn_agent` tool description from the first five picker-visible entries. If both DeepSeek entries are after those five entries, the model exists in the full catalog but is not shown in the tool description, so the main agent is unlikely to discover the slug automatically.

This explains why the same config can work when explicitly prompted with `deepseek-v4-flash`, while DeepSeek is missing from the visible candidate text.

## CCSwitchMulti fix

CCSwitchMulti now supports a private catalog field:

```json
{
  "modelCatalog": {
    "models": [
      { "model": "gpt-5.5", "displayName": "GPT-5.5" },
      { "model": "qwen3.6", "displayName": "Qwen3.6 Local" },
      { "model": "deepseek-v4-flash", "displayName": "DeepSeek V4 Flash" }
    ],
    "spawnAgentModels": [
      "gpt-5.5",
      "qwen3.6",
      "deepseek-v4-flash"
    ]
  }
}
```

The field is edited from the Codex provider model mapping UI. Users can select up to five catalog models and adjust their order. Those models are promoted to the front of the generated Codex catalog, so they enter Codex upstream's five-model `spawn_agent` description window.

If `spawnAgentModels` is absent, CCSwitchMulti keeps the fallback heuristic that promotes representative Qwen and DeepSeek models into the first five.

## Invariants

- The full catalog is preserved; non-selected models are not removed.
- Unknown selected model ids are ignored.
- The setting only changes catalog order for Codex visibility.
- It does not change default model selection, route matching, upstream auth, OAuth preservation, speed tiers, history provider buckets, or request statistics attribution.
